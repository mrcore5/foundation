## Mrcore Foundation Module

This is an mRcore module that provides the foundation of mrcore itself.

The foundation provides the asset manager and advanced module and dynamic app loading system for Laravel or Lumen.

Essentially, this is what turns Laravel into mRcore!

## What Is Mrcore

Mrcore is a set of Laravel and Lumen components used to build various systems.
It is a framework, a development platform and a CMS.  It is my modularized version of Laravel!

See https://github.com/mreschke/mrcore5 for details and installation instructions.
