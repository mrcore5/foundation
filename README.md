## Mrcore Foundation v2.0

This is an mRcore module that provides the foundation of mrcore itself.

The foundation provides the asset manager and advanced module and dynamic app loading system for Laravel.

Essentially, this is what turns Laravel into mRcore!

## What Is Mrcore

Mrcore is a set of Laravel components used to build various systems.
It is a framework, a development platform and a CMS.  It is a modularized version of Laravel
providing better package development support.  Think of Laravel 4.x workbenches on steroids.

See https://github.com/mrcore5/framework for details and installation instructions.
